Detect Dirty Form
=================

Jquery code for detecting dirty form.

Functionality: Alert if form is dirty when leaving the page. Toggle submit button on in case the form is modified. Toggle submit button off in case the form is changed back to its initial state. Works with TinyMCE.

How it works: The content of the form is hashed to check if changes have been made.
